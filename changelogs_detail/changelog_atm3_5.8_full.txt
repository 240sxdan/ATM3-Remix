			Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.1 or higher.

	The Lost Cities (went from lostcities-1.12-1.0.2.jar to lostcities-1.12-2.0.2.jar):
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.2.jar:
			2.0.2:

			 * New spawnNotInBuilding config to avoid spawning in buildings 
			 * Fixed registration of loot tables so that it actually works now 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.1.jar:
			2.0.1:

			 * allowedBiomeFactors and generatorOptions were in the wrong config category! Be careful when updating and make sure to move the options if you did custom changes! 
			 * New strategy option to generate translated biomes in case you want to limit the biomes in a world. The default strategy is 'original' but if you select 'randomized' it will try a more random distribution so that more biomes get a chance to be selected. If you chose 'varied' then it will be more sloppy about detecting what biomes are the same or not 
			 * Add sanity check in case a biome is not properly registered to the biome registry 
			 * Registered the Lost City loot tables to the loot table registry 
			 * New 'singleBiome' config option to specify that city spheres should only have a single random biome 
			 * The monorail crossing will now correctly be empty too (no water/rubble in it). Just like the other monorail parts 
			 * ILostSphere.getCenterPos() will now return the correct center position (with y level set correctly as well) 
			 * If you set the 'spawnSphere' config to '<in>' then the player will always spawn in a sphere. If you set the config option to '<out>' the player will spawn outside a sphere 
			 * If the 'debug' config option is set to true palette statistics as well as biome translation statistics are dumped to standard output (log file) at startup 
			 * New 'manualBiomeMappings' configuration option to manually override how some biomes map to others. This can be used in combination with allowedBiomeFactors to get more control over the final distribution 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0.jar:
			2.0.0:

			Changelog:

			 * 
			New landscape types:

			 * Floating: this landscape type generates floating islands on which cities (buildings and streets) can generate. This landscape type is likely not suitable for general overworld play because villages and strongholds are not generated by default. This profile can be useful to set as a type for the Lost City dimension or for specialized packs 
			 * Cavern: a nether-like world going up to 128 with bedrock on top. Cities generate in big caverns. This type of map is very dark and dangerous but otherwise useful as a replacement for the overworld. Good luck surviving the first days though 
			 * Space: in this landscape type there are big spheres that generate through the world. These spheres can contain cities (but not always) and can optionally be connected with a monorail system. The landscape outside the spheres can be configured as well. There are three example profiles using this landscape type: 
			 * biosphere: spheres containing jungles and cities and the outside world a wasteland with very badly damaged and ruined cities 
			 * space: spheres floating in the void connected with monorails 
			 * waterbubbles: spheres floating in a huge ocean connected with monorails 
			 * 
			New configuration possibilities:

			 * It is now possible to completely disable highways and railways 
			 * There are a few new client side configs for fog density, color and the height of the horizon. These configs only work if the client has Lost Cities installed as well 
			 * Worlds using 'space' landscape type have an optional secondary profile that is used for the outside. That way the landscape in the spheres can be totally different (including different biomes) from the landscape outside 
			 * New configuration options to avoid foliage of all types. You can now avoid mushrooms, flowers, trees, and so on 
			 * New configuration option to avoid the vanilla fossil generation. Useful for void type worlds 
			 * Supports for bridges and highways are optional and disabled in void style worlds 
			 * 
			New asset system options:

			 * The 'dontconnect' meta flag for parts will now also avoid generating doorways for floors that are adjacent to a street outside section or the top of an adjacent building 
			 * It is possible to define predefined spheres and disable the automatic generation of spheres. Useful for modpack makers. Every predefined sphere can have a different set of biomes 
			 * New 'isbuilding', 'issphere', and 'inbiome' conditions. These conditions can be used (for example) to control loot. Using this you can make sure that loot in the wasteland is different from loot in the spheres 
			 * It is now possible to use loot tables on dispeners, hoppers, shulker boxes as well as chests 
			 * It is now possible to use torches or light sources from other mods and have Lost City orient them correctly based on where they are placed 
			 * Added the ability to specify local named palettes in parts now 
			 * Cleanup the palette a bit. All rails are now in a separate palette. Keep this in mind if you were using those in custom assets 
			 * New 'nowater' boolean metadata for parts to make sure the ~ (air/water) never generates water even if under waterlevel. Used to avoid water in monorail system 
			 * 
			Spawns and teleportation:

			 * It is now possible to make sure that players spawn in a certain biome, in a certain predefined bity or in a certain predefined sphere 
			 * When spawning in a void type world Lost Cities will make sure the player spawns on solid ground 
			 * When teleporting to a void type Lost City world (using the bed+skulls system) Lost Cities will find a valid spot to teleport too. In addition Lost Cities will teleport the player back to a spawn bed if it can find one 
			 * 
			Various:

			 * Nicer profile selection gui. You can now see a small preview of the world you are about to create as well as a more verbose description 
			 * Better error handling in case chunk generation causes a crash (can be caused by invalid configuration). You get a log entry telling what chunk caused the problem and some information about that chunk 
			 * The API has been expanded with new support for the spheres 
			 * Added more optional torches to park parts to ensure that the new dark level types (like cavern) are a bit more playable 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0beta2.jar:
			2.0.0beta2:

			 * Better spawn control: you can now specify a predefined city or sphere to spawn in 
			 * Teleporting to the LC dimension (and back) works better. No more spawning in the void and if it can find a spawn bed in the destination (diamond blocks, bed, 6 skulls) it will put you there 
			 * Generalized the loottables so you can also use them for dispenser, shulker boxes, droppers, ... 
			 * Better check to make sure we only do things if we are actually in a Lost City worldgen (dimension or overworld). Avoids some Lost City things leaking over into other dimensions when they shouldn't 
			 * Small cleanups 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0beta1.jar:
			2.0.0beta:

			 * Reduce height of buildings near sphere border 
			 * Avoid cities and bridges at monorail stations 
			 * Multi buildings (2x2 chunk buildings) will no longer generate if part of them is on a city sphere border 
			 * The rails in monorail structures are now one lower 
			 * The monorail crossing actually allows travel in both directions now 
			 * The monorail station is rotatable in 4 directions and looks better now 
			 * The entire monorail system is lowered 6 blocks to align better with the lower level of the cities 
			 * New option to disable vanilla fossil generation. These looked really weird in void style world types 
			 * Added the ability to specify local named palettes in parts now 
			 * Cleanup the palette a bit. All rails are now in a separate palette. Keep this in mind if you were using those in custom assets 
			 * Highways look better in cavern landscapes because they no longer clear the space above them 
			 * Supports for bridges and highways are optional and disabled in void style worlds 
			 * Improved street/park generation for floating, cavern, and space 
			 * New 'nowater' boolean metadata for parts to make sure the ~ (air/water) never generates water even if under waterlevel. Used to avoid water in monorail system 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0alpha5.jar:
			2.0.0alpha5:

			 * Fixed a bug that exiting a world would remember the last used profile without being able to override it 
			 * Fixed predefined spheres so that they actually work 
			 * New more general system to specify 'torches' and how they should be faced when placed 
			 * Structure generation in chunks now uses the correct profile for that chunk 
			 * Fixed dirt being generated in city sphere buildings in some profiles 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0alpha4.jar:
			2.0.0alpha4:

			 * Fixed a bug where normal worlds and other dimensions would crash the game 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0alpha3.jar:
			2.0.0alpha3:

			 * Note: it is recommended to remove all Lost City configuration files first! 
			 * Limit cellars in biosphere/wasteland so that we don't accidentally generate cellars into the void (causing crashes) 
			 * Better error handling in case chunk generation causes a crash. A proper error will be put in the log indicating what chunk went wrong and some data about that chunk 
			 * New 'isbuilding', 'issphere', and 'inbiome' conditions. These conditions can be used (for example) to control loot. Using this you can make sure that loot in the wasteland is different from loot in the spheres 
			 * The API has been expanded with new support for the spheres 
			 * New configuration option to specify a spawn biome for the player. When this is present Lost Cities will find a spawn spot for new players that matches the given biome. The 'biosphere' profile uses this to make sure that the player always spawns inside a sphere 
			 * Experimental new 'cavern' landscape type. This is similar to how the nether generates but then with regular stone and biomes. The height of this landscape is limited to 128 and there is a bedrock layer on top (like the nether). The 'cavern' profile that uses this new landscape type is by default configured so that buildings have torches in them and parks are lit up. This helps for safety and making sure there is some light around you. Note that this remains a dangerous profile and also slightly heavy on performance 
			 * Added more optional torches to park parts to make the cavern type profile slightly less dark 
			 * Lost Cities is still a mod that doesn't have to be present on clients. So you can use servers with this mod and let vanilla clients connect to that server. However, if Lost Cities is present on the client then there are now additional configuration options that you can set per profile. Options like the height of the horizon and the color of the distance fog 
			 * New configuration options to avoid foliage of all types. You can now avoid mushrooms, flowers, trees, and so on 
			 * The 'dontconnect' meta flag for parts will now also avoid generating doorways for floors that are adjacent to a street outside section or the top of an adjacent building 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0alpha2.jar:
			2.0.0alpha2:

			 * Bug fix on some clients 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.0alpha1.jar:
			First alpha of Lost Cities 2.0.0:

			 * New floating island cities 
			 * New sphere type worlds. There are three variants provided: biosphere (jungle spheres in a wasteland), waterbubbles (floating city spheres partially submerged in water), and space (floating city spheres in space) 
			 * It is now possible to disable highways and railways completely 
			 * The 'space' landscape type (used for sphere worlds) have the ability to use a child profile for the outside of the spheres. This is used by waterbubbles and biosphere) 
			 * It is possible to completely disable the automatic generation of spheres and only use predefined spheres (configurable in the asset system) 
			 * City spheres can have totally different biomes compared to the outside landscape 
			 * In the new landscape types the player will always spawn on a valid spot. Either inside a sphere or on a floating island 
			 * New monorail system to connect city spheres 
			 * Nicer profile selection gui. You can now see a small preview of the world you are about to create as well as a more verbose description

			 * Has 2x2 stone tiles on the end. 
			 * Comes in normal, mossy, and cracked variants. 
			 * Nagastone Pillar

			 * Block is available in 3 axal rotations. 
			 * Works like vanilla Quartz Pillar Block. 
			 * Comes in normal, mossy, and cracked variants. 
			 * Nagastone Stairs

			 * Texture like Etched Nagastone. 
			 * Has Left and Right facing variants dictating which way the swirls go. 
			 * Both Left and Right come in normal, mossy, and cracked variants. 
			 * Spiral Stone Bricks

			 * Can be used in a 2x2 patterns to make a complete spiral. 
			 * The block itself is in 3D and has depth not only through shading.

			CHANGED:

			 * Block And Chain now appears from your left hand if used in the off-hand slot.

			 * Also cleaned up the code around there. 
			 * shifted the Knightmetal Loop texture to the middle. 
			 * Block and Chain + Cube of Annihilation leave their x16 boundary to accommodate their texture. 
			 * Made the Block and Chain thicker when held. 
			 * The Block and Chain received a model override, the texture will change to only the loop when it is thrown.

			 * Cube of Annihilation received a new texture for this too.

			 * Broke the fourth wall, wont fix. 
			FIXES:

			 * Made the player invulnerable when teleporting across dimensions, this was the issue causing players to wrongly teleport.

			 * Fixed the issue when going through a portal would displace you up in the air. 
			 * Moved the language key for "Underbrick Floor" from meta 2 to meta 3 to fix lang entry collision for Underbrick. 
			 * Fixed a crash that happened due to the mod OpenTerrainGenerator. 
			 * Magic Beans once again properly grow into beanstalks on dedicated servers. 
			 * The vignette that appears in low light no longer randomly flickers in the Twilight Forest. 
			 * Fixed Root Strands being offset downwards for the second time, hopefully preventing them to sag with age. 
			 * Placing a giant block where it would replace a snow layer no longer crashes the client. 
			 * Moonworm Queen no longer breaks like a tool when it hits 0 durability.

			 * Only the Moonworm Queen you're using should wiggle now instead of all of them when you have multiple. 
			 * Scepter of Twilight/Life Draining once again can be recharged. 
			 * Fixed the broken fourth wall.
