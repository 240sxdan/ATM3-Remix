	Natura (went from natura-1.12.2-4.3.2.42.jar to natura-1.12.2-4.3.2.49.jar):
		natura-1.12.2-4.3.2.49.jar:
			New:

			 * Added en_ED.lang
			 * Added zh_TW.lang
			Bugfixes:

			 * Flowers can now be able to placed on Topiary Grass
			 * @SideOnly has been removed from getSubBlocks

	NuclearCraft (went from NuclearCraft-2.10i--1.12.2 to NuclearCraft-2.10j--1.12.2):
		NuclearCraft-2.10j--1.12.2:
			+ Added extra control buttons to Fusion Reactor

			* Fixed default active water cooling rate
			+ Added config option to use Ctrl rather than Shift for tooltip info

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.5.1-163.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.3-181.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.3-181.jar:
			 * Fix: Shift-click dupe bug (introduced in 0.6.0) when clicking items into some PneumaticCraft inventories.
			 * Fix: Dyeing a drone by right-clicking it now only uses one dye from the stack, not two.
			 * Fix: Blocks can now be placed against the Charging Station & Elevator Caller by with sneak-right-click.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.2-179.jar:
			 * Fix: Server crash when Spawner Agitators are used in conjunction with the Despawning Spawners mod.
			 * Fix: Omnidirectional Hoppers now respect the sidedness of the block they pull from (e.g. will no longer pull input items or fuel from the bottom side of a vanilla furnace).
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.1-176.jar:
			* Fix: Crash with liquid lookup with JEI.
			* Fix: Drones being quirky sometimes when digging.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.6.0-174.jar:
			* Added Harvesting Drone, and Harvesting Piece.
			* QoL improvement: Speed Upgrades can now be crafted with fluid containers holding more than a bucket of lubricant. The Liquid Hopper works for this, and the Thermal Expansion and EnderIO tanks can also be used. Other mods' containers may also work.
			* QoL improvement: adding extra Refinery blocks to an existing stack will now automatically redistribute any output fluids to the appropriate tanks, so the Refinery can continue to run. E.g. adding a Refinery to a 2-block stack which already contains Diesel and LPG will auto-move the LPG from the second to the third (newly added) block.
			* Programmable Controller: all faces except the bottom face can be used to access the fake drone's inventory. The bottom face can be used to insert or extract the programmable item (Drone or Network API).
			* QoL improvement: Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now only accepts items/fluids that can be used in recipes.
			* Fix (cosmetic): Amadron no longer shows slot highlights where there isn't a trade widget (i.e. on the last page of trades).
			* Fix: Breaking any PneumaticCraft tile entity with an auto-smelt pick (e.g. from Tinker's Construct) no longer smelts the tile entity's contents.
			* Fix: MCMP2 support hard-disabled for now (switching it on in config would crash your game before)
			* Fix: Elevator Caller now works properly when you have more than 12 floors
			* Fix: Programmable Controller inventory handling now works properly (inventory manipulation widgets were accessing the controller's 1-slot inventory instead of the fake drone's inventory)
			* Fix: Removing the programmable item (Drone or Network API) from the Programmable Controller's slot now properly stops and resets the running program.
			* Fix: Rotating PNC blocks with other mods' wrenches should no longer also open the block's GUI.
			* Fix: The Charging Station now only allows 1 item to be inserted, to prevent duping Machine Upgrades.
			* Performance: fluid tank rendering now uses a FastTESR, better for client FPS.

					option if you like.
				-Lots of backend work to support new features.
