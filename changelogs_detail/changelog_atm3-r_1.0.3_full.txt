	Morph-o-Tool (went from Morph-o-Tool-1.2-18.jar to Morph-o-Tool-1.2-21.jar):
		Morph-o-Tool-1.2-21.jar:
			- Added the ability to manually morph the tool by scrolling while holding shift. (MoreThanHidden)

	Multi Mob Library (went from multimob-1.0.3.jar to multimob-1.0.5.jar):
		multimob-1.0.5.jar:
			Changelog 1.0.5: Small but essential fixes

			Important: If suddenly a lot of zombies start spawning; please reset your config! Should not happen though. Sorry for the inconvenience if it does!

			- Fixed zombies no longer being able to spawn!!! (oof)

			- Fixed that new entries were potentially ignored

			- Fixed that passing in negative values to certain config options would crash the game

			- Fixed that the new Filler entries were not working as intended
		multimob-1.0.4a.jar:
			Changelog 1.0.4a hotfix:

			- Added some "Filler" spawn entries; these are used by the weight system to make sure the amount of mobs spawned using the MultiMob creature types stays in-check. This will result in fewer Primitive Mobs spawns (if you have that mod installed) in general; but should also help with the Skeleton Warrior spam a bit. Put the filler entry spawn weight to 0 to disable them.

			- Fixed that removing an entity entry would still attempt to spawn them

			- Fixed a crash with Botania's Floating Flowers and the camouflage armor/chameleon

			- Fixed mobs sometimes spawning on Mushroom Biomes

			- Fixed that mobs spawning through MultiMob would ignore mods that prevent mobs from spawning.

			- Added some more safety code for the world spawner.
		multimob-1.0.4.jar:
			v1.0.4 changelog:

			Please remove the previous MultiMob config after updating! Sorry for the inconvenience.

			The newest PrimitiveMobs v1.2.3 and TheSummoner v1.0.4 versions will need this MultiMob version.

			Spawn System REDONE:

			- The system now uses new EnumCreatureTypes to simply add spawns to the vanilla system

			- Use the AdditionalSpawningOptions in the config to enable a complementary system which can be used to increase spawns; will add info to the main curseforge page soon. It also has a bunch of customization options.

			- Fixed that mobs using the BackOff AI would spawn fires when running

			- Fixed that the StealFromPlayer AI would not handle stacksizes properly; causing dupes

			- Added some base code for Dynamic Trees integrations

			- Added additional modpack maker files to the file generation which show all Potions, Potion Types and Enchantments

			- Adding new spawns through the config can still be done on runtime; however removing them will require a restart now.

			The last release introduced a bug that made the Tinker Tank unusable. Now it can be used again!
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.113.jar:
			Added several checks to alloy recipes, to prevent startup if there are recipes that don't make sense and might break the game/crash. Things like vanishing fluids and/or crashes when certain liquids are in the smeltery should no longer happen with this, BUT it might be that existing mods might not start anymore, if they add broken recipes!

			 *
			Add a few checks to advancements, to prevent potential crashes and/or unnecessary lag

			 *
			Fixed invalid smeltery configuration that would allow to have a smeltery controller on the floor level, which could couse crashes

			 *
			Fixes an issue where fluids are non-default then get switched to default on world load, but never had their texture loaded. You typically did not notice it with Tinkers fluids since we have so many that one is almost gaurenteed to be default, but better to be on the safe side

			 *
			Updated german localization
