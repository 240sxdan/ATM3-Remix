			 * Tinkers' Construct integration!
			 * Added Tinker's Construct Integration with Naga Scales, Steeleaves, Fiery Ingots, Knightmetal Ingots, and Raven's Feathers to make materials & tools out of.
			 * Added unique traits for each material:
			 * Twilit appears on all Twilight Forest materials, meaning your tool gains +2 speed in the Twilight Forest and deals +2 damage in any other dimension.
			 * Precipitate appears on Naga Scale materials, it lets you use the tool quicker with the lesser health on your Player.
			 * Synergy appears on Steeleaf materials, it will passively repair the tool if you have Steeleaf in your hotbar. The more Steeleaves you have in the hotbar, the faster it repairs.
			 * Stalwart appears on Knightmetal materials, it will make you more resilient in combat.

			 * Added config option for players spawning for the first time to spawn in the Twilight Forest. Off by default.
			 * Added config option to make Twilight Portals create a blocked-off portal at their destination. Toss in the activation item to unblock the portal. Off by default.
			 * Added recipes where Iron armor and tools can be crafted directly into their Fiery counterparts.
			 * Added Shield-Parrying for all Twilight Forest Projectiles. Installing [Shield Parry](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/parry) mod causes Twilight Forest to skip its parrying methods.
			 * Updated the Japanese language file.
			 * Updated the Chinese language file.
			 * The Russian language file now covers everything in the mod.
			CHANGED:

			 * Changed the Creative menu icon to the Miniature Portal item.

			 * Mazestone and its variants once again consume 16 durability from your mining tools when mined.
			 * Castle Doors no longer have their texture broken.
			 * Charm of Life effect upon death now uses the correct sprite.
			 * Improved algorithm for the Miner's Tree, it should be less confused and stuck when trying to pull ores from the ground.
			 * Fixed some blocks missing getBlockFaceShape overrides, causing glass panes, fences, walls, etc. to connect to blocks when they shouldn't.
			 * Fixed the placement problems with Spiral Bricks and took off the [WIP] tag.
			 * Finally fixed texture and UV problems with Knightly Armor and Phantom Armor; rejoice!
			 * Ur-Ghast's tears should be visible again in Multiplayer when it's throwing a tantrum.
