			+ improve the placement (faster as it only looks for a slice of the chunk) + add an optional param for the dimension

			 * the chance for a soul on a decorative grave doesn't matter if the chunk/world is loaded or not (based on the last checked time and how many checks has been skipped and one unique test (with probability), the check is now done every 30 minutes (and the config doesn't limit the chance value)

			Changes 2.9.3 : (special thanks to Gegy & Ichttt)

			NB : don't use the command loadplayer on a dead player, or he'll need to relog (i'll improve this soon)
			 * config options to allow to backup the players automatically (max 5 saves by playerId, and the default value enables this feature every 60 minutes)

			 * provisory fix for "welcome to the jungle" to prevent the mod to cancel grave

			 * only trigger the advancement "first_grave" if the grave is really built
			 * provisory fix for "welcome to the jungle" to prevent the mod to cancel grave

			 * add a compatibility for FTB Utilities : redirect the command "back" from this mod to the grave position (disabled by default in config)

			- the tablet can be enchanted to allow teleportation
			- work like a "grave's key" (showing at distance, and doesn't consume the item, but requires to be enchanted each time for teleportation)

			 * provisory fix for "welcome to the jungle" to prevent the mod to cancel grave

			 * compatibility with "ice & fire" (dragons could transform the grave into charred blocks)
			 * update baubles api
			 * some changes about grave placement and teleportation
			- the placer looks for positions to the up & down on the same time

			=> ideal pattern for grave is a place where you can tp over the grave and with a safe ground below the grave

			 * check if the last grave is close when generating a new grave, and fill the grave if it has enough space
			Changes 2.2.0 :

	McJtyLib (went from McJtyLib - 1.12-3.0.4 to McJtyLib - 1.12-3.0.5):
		McJtyLib - 1.12-3.0.5:
			 - Joseph fixed a crash when dragging the mouse outside of a color picker
			 - Added support for fixing problems with early client->server packets that would sometimes fire before the server had a chance to setup networking for that client
			 - Worked around a bug in Mekanism which would cause the XNet network data to load too early causing it to be destroyed again at the time the server starts (the event for which occurs after loading the world). This cleanup has now moved to right before the server starts to load anything

			0.8.0-267 (17 Sep 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#new)New

			 * Logistics frames now support fuzzy item meta and NBT matching, as well as whitelist/blacklist for filters. This can all be configured with a new side tab on the right of the logistics GUI. Default is whitelist, match meta, ignore NBT, as before.
			 * Shulkers can be now be hacked (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker & Security Upgrades). Disables Shulker missile attack and (usually) forces them open.
			 * Some quality of life improvements to Drone Debugging (Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker and Dispenser upgrades):
			 * In the debug screen, any widget which has an area can be right-clicked to show the area in-world. Right-click again to stop showing the area.
			 * Added "Show Start" and "Show Active" buttons to jump the debug display to the Start widget or currently executing widget, respectively.
			 * Added "Follow Active" checkbox, which when selected, will continuously jump the debug display to the currently executing widget.
			 * Aerial Interface and Programmable Controller now have a GUI tab to configure which sides of the block should be connected to which inventory:
			 * Default for Aerial Interface is top & bottom -> armor slots, sides -> player main inventory, as before.
			 * Default for Programmable Controller is bottom -> programmable slot, other faces -> fake drone inventory, as before.
			 * Aerial Interface now also supports interfacing with player's offhand slot and (vanilla) Ender inventory.
			 * Additionally, any face of the two blocks can be disconnected from any inventory.
			 * Both blocks are now rotatable (this is required for side configuration to work properly). Default rotation for any pre-existing blocks is North - you can rotate the blocks as normal with a wrench.
			 * Both blocks have had a bit of a re-texture to make it clear where the front is.
			 * Explosion crafting (i.e. converting iron to compressed iron via an explosion) is now manageable with CraftTweaker:
			 * Arbitrary mappings of input item (or oredict entry) to output item can now be added or removed, but the mapping is always 1:1, with a configurable (average) loss rate.
			 * API docs will eventually be on [https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fcrafttweaker.readthedocs.io%252fen%252flatest%252f%2523Mods%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252f)but in the meantime see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/108](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/108)
			 * The config setting I:configCompressedIngotLossRate still exists, but applies only to the default compressed iron ingot & block recipes added by the mod. For general loss rate configuration, use CraftTweaker.
			 * JEI display for explosion crafting has changed slightly due to the possibilty of multiple possible recipes for one output; the description text is now a tooltip shown by hovering over the little explosion icon.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Speed Upgrades are now slightly less expensive to use in machines in terms of fuel usage and heat generation. Default multiplier is now 1.65, down from 1.8. Note that this is exponential: usage is multiplier_value^num_speed_upgrades.
			 * The multipliers for Speed Upgrades are now configurable, in the "machine_properties" section of the config: D:speedUpgradeSpeedMultiplier and D:speedUpgradeUsageMultiplier.
			 * Several crafting recipes now produce more output:
			 * All logistics frames: 4 frames instead of 1
			 * Pneumatic Cylinder: 2 cylinders instead of 1
			 * All programming puzzle pieces: 8 pieces instead of 4
			 * UV Light Box progress rate is now dependent on the exposure level of the PCB it's processing: much faster at low levels, a little slower at high levels. The overall time it takes to fully expose a PCB (10 minutes with no speed upgrades) is unchanged, but this makes for a more interesting tradeoff of processing speed vs. etching failure chance (previously there was no good reason not to expose a PCB to 100%).
			 * When UV Light Box is set to emit a redstone signal at a given exposure level, automated (piped) extraction is only possible when the exposure level is high enough to emit a signal. This makes for easier automation, but note that vanilla hoppers won't work here due to redstone signal emission; use an Omnidirectional Hopper or some other item transport system.
			 * Entity Selector strings (as used in Sentry Turret, Drone Programs, (advanced) Air Grate Module can now be a sequence of filters, separated by ";". If any element of the sequence matches, the filter matches. e.g. "@mob;shulker" will match any mob or a shulker (shulkers, although hostile, are considered by Minecraft to be golems rather than mobs).
			 * The minimum temperature for fluids to be considered as fuels for Liquid Compressors has been raised to 373K (100C) and is now configurable (see I:minimumFluidFuelTemperature)
			 * When using a Pneumatic Helmet with Entity Tracker installed, drones no longer automatically show redstone particles where they're working; you now also need to have the Entity Tracker enabled, and have a Dispenser Upgrade installed (which is also required for drone debugging). You also need to be within 32 blocks of the drone.
			 * Jet Boots flight is now a little more hazardous at Hard difficulty level; you will take more damage from horizontal collisions, and your boots won't absorb all the fall damage if you hit the ground while thrusting.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Removing a drone or Network API from the programmable controller now resets its digging position, preventing a phantom digging laser being shown.
			 * Fixed item loss bug with logistics drones and logistics modules when requesting a specific number of items from a Requester Frame with some (but not all) non-vanilla inventories.
			 * Logistics Frames can now once more be configured when in item form by right clicking (this is an old 1.7.10 feature that stopped working in the port to 1.12.2).
			 * Logistics Frame item tooltips now once more show their filter settings when shift is held (again, old 1.7.10 feature).
			 * WAILA/TOP info now shows detailed Logistics Frame filter information when player sneaks.
			 * Logistics Requester Frame now correctly requests fluids when the receiving tank is empty.
			 * Fixed log spam for Aphorism tile (was wrongly sending sync packets from client side)
