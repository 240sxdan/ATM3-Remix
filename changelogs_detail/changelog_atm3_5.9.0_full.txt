			 vanilla water and lava. Calling #setHardness subsequently sets the
			 blockResistance (blockHardness * 5.0F) which handles resistence to
			 explosions.
			 An exception was made for quicksand, which initializes to the same
			 hardness as minecraft:sand (0.5F) so that explosions won't leave piles
			 of quicksand floating around.

		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.14.0.jar:
			 New feature: ore blocks in the nether and end for 28 ore types, 2 blocks per ore for endstone and netherrack versions (For example: Nether Copper Ore, End Cobalt Ore, etc). 

			They are compatible with any resource pack, (the ore layer is transparent and it goes on top of whatever netherrack or end_stone texture your resource pack adds)

			These are all disabled by default as you can see in the new 'cyclic_ores.cfg' file and can be enabled in a batch or one by one.

			These have NO USE AT ALL in this mod alone, but they are all compatible with the ore dictionary and are meant for use in machines and recipes from OTHER mods. This is for modpack devs who could pick and chose which ores to enable if needed.

			Existing vanilla nether and end ores are unchanged, and are affected by the same configs as before.

	Tesla Core Lib (went from Tesla Core Lib : 1.12 - 1.0.12 to Tesla Core Lib : 1.0.13.8):
		Tesla Core Lib : 1.0.13.8:
			- fixed problem with conflict between 'allowMachinesToSpawnItems' and tesla wrench picking up tile entities
			- added pt_BR translation
			- fixed issue #31: [https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/Tesla-Core-Lib/issues/31](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopmentMods/Tesla-Core-Lib/issues/31)

			- moved to MMD servers
			- jar should now be signed

	The Lost Cities (went from lostcities-1.12-2.0.2.jar to lostcities-1.12-2.0.5.jar):
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.5.jar:
			2.0.5:

			 * The spawnSphere <out> setting wasn't working properly. Additionally it was impossible to spawn in the outside world on a biosphere world because it restricted spawn height to above 60 (and default ground level is 40) 
			 * Better crash log entry in case the client is not having a profile that the server is using 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.4.jar:
			2.0.4:

			 * More fixes for sponge compatibility 
		lostcities-1.12-2.0.3.jar:
			2.0.3:

			 * Cleaned up ground level handling for dual profile worlds (like biosphere). The 'outsideGroundLevel' setting is now obsolete. Instead you should use the 'groundLevel' setting from the child profile (previously that was ignored). In addition the waterLevelOffset from the main profile is now actually used for that profile (so the inside of spheres) and not for the outside world anymore. This means that it is now actually possible to get water generation inside the spheres and even flood them. Lost Cities will automatically detect the old 'outsideGroundLevel' setting and migrate it to the new format. Basically that means that when it discovers a profile that has an 'outsideGroundLevel' that is different from -1 it will do the following: 
			 * Set the 'groundLevel' in the child profile to the current value of 'outsideGroundLevel' 
			 * Set the 'waterLevelOffset' in the child profile to the 'waterLevelOffset' of the main profile 
			 * Set 'outsideGroundLevel' in the main profile to -1 (not used) 
			 * Set 'waterLevelOffset' in the main profile to the default 8 
			 * Worked around an issue with sponge compatibility. Additionally this means there is now a new ILostCities api that other mods should use instead of the 'instanceof ILostChunkGenerato<wbr />r' trick 
			 * 'Border' generation is now much nicer for cities in city spheres. Borders are generated when a city chunk generates adjacent to a lower other chunk 
			 * Disabled villages in 'cavern' as the villages spawn on top of the world (above bedrock) 

	The One Probe (went from theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.19.jar to theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.21.jar):
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.21.jar:
			1.4.21:

			 * Joseph fixed a bug with REALLY big energy containers 
			 * McJty made sure TOP no longer crashes in case rendering an item crashes (like some items from bibliocraft seem to do). It will report an 'error' message instead 
		theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.20.jar:
			1.4.20:

			New features:

			 * Added TESLA support 
			 * Added support for the new large power cell from RFTools Power (McJty) 
			 * Item frames now display their item 
			Enhancements:

			And lots of refactoring and code cleanup.
