	Cyclic (went from Cyclic-1.12.2-1.15.9.jar to Cyclic-1.12.2-1.15.8.jar):
		Cyclic-1.12.2-1.15.9.jar:
			UPDATE: Users have reported several strange issues with this version so I have downgraded it to alpha status. Download 1.15.10 instead

			 * Ender Library now faces a specific direction and only renders books on that side (Use wooden wrench if you need to rotate any already placed).
			 * Improved connected-ness of Fluid storage tank: if the bottom tank is full, using a full bucket on it will fill tanks above.
			 * New block: Dice.
			 * New block: Imbue Station.
			 * New item: Rainbow Cannon.
			 * Placing a bucket into a lower tank will fill a tank connected above it.
			 * Pattern Builder now has two new ways to render the copied building: Phantom and Solid render, both preview a fake version of the actual block in the world.
			 * Storage Bag can now be tweaked into 16 colours.
			 * Fixed issue where you hold down right-click on a toggle item for it to spam between on-off rapidly (climbing gloves, charms, etc).
			 * Fixed Energy Cables and blocks not outputting to some machines that only accept power on one single side in some cases (such as mekanism cables in corner shape, or IE Charging Station).
			 * Fixed Excavate enchant not working on tools with multiple types (such as the Mattock or paxels).
			 * Battery now renders its energy contents on the block face in world, and also as a durability bar.
			 * Battery is registered as an itemstack capability, meaning it can be charged up while in item form.
			 * Updated zh_CN.lang thanks to user sandtechnology.
			 * Rotating Conveyors using a Wooden Wrench (or other tools with similar function) now lets you toggle between all variations such as straight, corner, angle.
			 * Added basic tools crafted from Netherbricks.
			 * Fixed an issue where disabled cable sides (the yellow square from a redstone torch) still was accepting input from the other side.
			 * You can now disconnect cables by hitting the middle of the connection with a redstone torch.
			 * Added slider controls to the Fluid & Energy extractor cables to change flow speed.
			 * Removed TRANSFER_FLUID_PER_TICK and TRANSFER_ENERGY_PER_TICK from cable config file since it is now controlled by the pump.
