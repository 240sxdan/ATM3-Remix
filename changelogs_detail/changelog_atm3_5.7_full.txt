			Initial release

	Draconic Evolution (went from Draconic Evolution 1.12-2.3.7.278-universal to Draconic Evolution 1.12-2.3.8.279-universal):
		Draconic Evolution 1.12-2.3.8.279-universal:
			-Re added toggle flight key binding
			-Fixed entity path finding crash related to placed items.

	UniDict (went from UniDict-1.12.2-1.9b.jar to UniDict-1.12.2-2.3.1.jar):
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.0.jar:
			CraftTweaker support:
			mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate(String outputKind, int outputSize, String[][] shape); mods.unidict.api.newShapelessRecipeTemplate(String outpuKind, int outputSize, String[] inputs); mods.unidict.removalByKind.crafting(String kindName); 
			the first two commands are for creating all the recipes for a given kind, per example, if you want change all you gear recipe to have a different shape, then now you don't need to create one by one.
			the last command will be used to remove recipes for a given kind, if you pass it the argument "block", then it will remove all the recipes for blocks, like iron block, copper block, gold block, and etc... (I will expand this on the future for mod machines)

			for more informations about CraftTweaker support, check out [this](https:/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.reddit.com%252fr%252ffeedthebeast%252fcomments%252f7n1cg5%252funidict_112220_update%252f).

			New: a config option to blacklist some ItemStacks in Unification (resquested by [lanse505](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/lanse505))

			there are several other improvements on the source code, like resource gathering, but including all them here would make this changelog huge =D

			so, I guess this is the last version of UniDict... for 2017! I wish you all a Happy new year!
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.1.jar:
			1.12.2-2.1:

			 * now resource gathering is made on init (this will need some testing in order to see if there are no negative effects.). 
			 * now you can pass null values (for the shape)for the CraftTweaker command mods.unidict.api.newShapedRecipeTemplate() without crashing. 
			 * added a new "RemoveByKind" CT command, "furnace". 
			 * added the method "addItemStackToBlackList" to UniDictAPI, this will allow modders to "blacklist" ItemStacks directly (resquested by [SkySom](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/SkySom)) 
			 * 
			added an optional parameter "String[] resourceKindWhiteList" for the CT commands "mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("crafting")" and "mods.unidict.removalByKind,get("furnace")"
			is is basically a filter, that it will remove recipes only when the resource contains the given "kinds".

			 * changed how to use the "RemovalByKind" CT Command

			now it is needed to "get" the wanted "RemovalByKind".
			usage:
			"val removalByKind = mods.unidict.removalByKind.get("removalByKindName")""
			it will return the wanted "RemovalByKind" instance, as long you passed it a valid value.
			currently the valid values are ("crafting", "furnace")
			(probably I will have to create a "wiki" to explain better these things XD)

			added another "RemovalByKind", the "furnace"
			it works exactly as the "crafting" variant, but for the furnace.

			after getting the "RemovalByKind" instance, in order to use, use the "remove" method, it uses the same arguments as before.

			isn't required to store the "instance" in a val, but if you want to use it several times, it is better.
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.2.jar:
			New Integration:

			 * Kitsu's ForgeCraft (Anvil, Bloomery, Casting, Forge) 
			Fixed an huge memory leak (maybe not so huge).

			Changed:

			 * now the UniDict CraftTweaker commands will be executed on the end of Initialization, to avoid conflicts with another CraftTweaker commands. 
			 * some internal changes. 
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.2b.jar:
			fix [Issue#72](https://github.com/WanionCane/UniDict/issues/72)
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.3.jar:
			New:

			 * added a confog option to make Crafting Integration ignore recipes created by certain mods ("S:ignoreModIdRecipes") 
			 * now modders can create their own Integrations, use @UniDict.Integration annottation, and extends AbstractIntegrationThread.
			how to create an integration: [wanion.unidict.integration](https://github.com/WanionCane/UniDict/tree/1.12.2/src/main/java/wanion/unidict/integration), it is undocumented, but it is really easy to do.
			it is possible to specify which loading stage your integration will run, check the @SpecifiedLoadStage annotation. 
			Fixed Thermal Expansion Integration, it was broken because of changes on the lastest Thermal Expansion.
		UniDict-1.12.2-2.3.1.jar:
			Added two config options to ignore certain ItemStacks on Furnace Integration
			"furnaceInputsToIgnore", and "furnaceOutputsToIgnore".
