	Minecraft Forge (went from 1.12.2-14.23.5.2811 to 1.12.2-14.23.5.2815)

	Modpack Configuration Checker (went from Modpack Configuration Checker-1.12.2-v1.6.1.jar to Modpack Configuration Checker-1.12.2-v1.7.jar):
		Modpack Configuration Checker-1.12.2-v1.7.jar:
			 * Ability to set a maximum amount of time the game can spend booting. (Thanks DFArun)
			 * Fixed crash that occurred when running mod on servers without a GUI.

	Mouse Tweaks (went from [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.9 to [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10):
		[1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10:
			 * Added a new setting for switching between "smooth scrolling, minor issues" and "non-smooth scrolling, no issues", set to smooth scrolling by default. The second option fixes a number of issues where Mouse Tweaks seemingly scrolls "through" another mod's GUI (namely JEI): [1](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/2), [2](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/17), [3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mouse-tweaks/files/19). Unfortunately, enabling the second option also makes the item scrolling a little non-smooth. Considering that the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible, the setting was left at "smooth scrolling" by default. Huge thanks to [@mezz](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/mezz) for [contributing the fix](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/pull/20) and explaining the underlying input mechanics.
			 * Fixed Mouse Tweaks clicking "through" some mods' GUIs (namely JEI): read above for details. The fix is active regardless of the smooth/non-smooth scrolling setting value.
			 * Added tooltips to all settings in the Forge Mod Options menu.
			 * Bumped the required Java version to 8. If this is a problem, please open an issue, it's possible to bring it back down to 6.

	Plants (went from Plants-1.12.2-2.10.4.jar to Plants-1.12.2-2.10.6.jar):
		Plants-1.12.2-2.10.6.jar:
			Fixes cascading generation issues with Bushes.
			Should fix a crash relating to calling getStateForPlacement from invalid meta on logs.
			May fix cascading issues relating to vine generation, if that was ever a problem.

			Crystals generate properly now, no longer checking if the bottom face is solid.
			This build has been marked as incompatible with Placebo 2.x.x, which is an upcoming rewrite of the library. This will also in turn cause a rewrite of plants, likely alongside a rename and possible total overhaul of the mod.
		Plants-1.12.2-2.10.5.jar:
			Bugfix for a crash relating to quark flowerpots.

			I know this isn't the kind of update anyone wants, but I do want to mention that Plants is going to be updated to 1.13 in the near future.
			This update may include a rebranding, since the name "Plants" seems to cause more trouble than it's worth. The 1.13 update will also cause a full rewrite, which will address issues such as [https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Plants/issues/18](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Plants/issues/18) that I know people have been asking for.

			I may begin this rewrite on 1.12, and cause a full-breaking change Plants 3.x.x branch on 1.12 while waiting for forge to exit beta.

	PlusTiC (went from plustic-7.0.2.1.jar to plustic-7.0.5.2.jar):

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.1-317.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.3-324.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.3-324.jar:
			Fixes

			 * FOV modifications (as done by Pneumatic Leggings with Speed Upgrades and Minigun with Entity Tracker Upgrades) should now cooperate much better with other mods, assuming those mods do their FOV calculations correctly too (see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/304](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/304)).
			 * Programmer GUI: Coordinate Operators will now report divide-by-zero attempts as an error instead of silently ignoring them.
			 * Fixed Thermopneumatic Processing Plant recipes not showing their temperature in JEI.
			 * Jet Boots Builder Mode speed modification should work better now in conjunction with other mods that modify dig speed (e.g. Aerial Affinity enchant).
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.2-321.jar:
			New

			 * If you have 8 or more Jet Boots Upgrades installed, it is now possible to switch to Jet Boots "Builder Mode"
			 * This allows more creative-like flight (where holding Space rises), but much slower movement
			 * Dig speed is improved while in the air and in Builder Mode (need 10 Jet Boots upgrades for full normal dig speed)
			 * Ideal when building and fine adjustment is needed. Normal mode is still much better for fast travel.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Pressure Chamber: interface doors now animate open and closing (like they did in 1.7.10)
			 * ComputerCraft/OpenComputers improvements:
			 * Significant performance improvement work
			 * Some thread-safety fixes
			 * Drone Interface now lights up green when a drone is connected
			 * Albedo support for the UV Lightbox has been dropped (could no longer reach the Maven repo)
			 * Chestplate Magnet now checks for items every 4 ticks instead of 8.
			 * Some performance improvements:
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant will use less server CPU when idle (smarter recipe checking)
			 * Charging Station will use less client CPU to render (static model instead of TESR to render charge pad upgrade) and process (was running some code that's only necessary server-side)
			 * Less network traffic for tile entity sync (machines no longer sync all their upgrades to clients, only those of specific interest)
			 * Item & Block tooltips are now a little more consistent & informative in a few places
			 * Minor GUI improvements for the Charging Station (primarily less cramped-looking)
			 * GUI pressure gauges use a smaller text size for the numbers around the edge of the gauge
			 * Entity/Block tracker & hacking: the popup "can hack" window now also notes which hotkey is used for hacking
			 * Patchouli guidebook is now advancement-gated, so only relevant sections of the book are displayed depending on how far you've progressed through the mod.
			 * Remote Editor: Spruced up the GUI a little. Added a snap-to-grid option to make it easier to line up widgets on the GUI.
			 * Universal Sensor: Added a "Global Analog Variable" sensor, which emits an analog (0..15) redstone signal based on the X value of the linked global variable. This is in addition to the existing "Global Variable" sensor which emits 15 if the linked variable is non-zero, and 0 otherwise.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed problem where machines could become unbreakable under some circumstances (related to trying to sneak-wrench a machine which had upgrades installed or other data that needs to be saved to the dropped item stack).
			 * Refinery comparator support: "has work" now correctly emits a signal when Refinery isn't up to temperature (the check is "has work", not "did work"). This makes it more useful for enabling/disabling a heat source for the Refinery, depending on if it has work to do.
			 * Fixed Remote Editor GUI not being able to modify the dimensions of button widgets.
			 * Added missing Patchouli docs page for the Remote.

		Thermal Logistics 0.2-16:
			ABOUT UPDATING TO 0.2-16
			0.2-16 contains a major overhaul of the request algorithm used behind the scenes. When updating from 0.1 to 0.2, Requesters and Crafters will remember their filters, but they won't remember what they were requesting. When updating, make sure your Terminals, Requesters, and Crafters are idle.

			New features:
			- New servo called the "Distributor". Acts exactly like a Servo, but prefers to send items to filters.
			- Crafters can now contain multiple recipes, with the Resonant Crafter being able to contain up to 6.
			- The Terminal has a new "Crafting" tab, where you can specify a recipe manually or using JEI autofill. You can then request the Terminal to get the ingredients for you.

			Enhancements:
			- The Terminal can now be placed anywhere you want.
			- Crafters have redstone control.
			- Crafters can be filled using JEI autofill.
			- Requesters don't request items from their own inventory anymore.
			- Major overhaul of the request algorithm used in Terminals, Requesters, and Crafters.
			- All variations of the Network Manager have been scrapped. Now there's only one type, and it doesn't use RF anymore.

			Bugs fixed:
			- Crafters accepting any items that enter. (#13)
			- Regularly occurring silent crash. (#16)
		Thermal Logistics 0.1-15:
			Fix issue with YABBA and StorageDrawers not being read correctly by the Terminal
