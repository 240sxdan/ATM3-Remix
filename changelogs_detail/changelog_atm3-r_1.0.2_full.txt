		tinkersoc-0.5.jar:
			Fixed calling client only methods on the server.

			Updated to Forge 2775 (newer versions have some issues with exception handling)

			Updated Tinkers, Mantle, and OC. Now requires OC 1.7.3 and Tinkers 2.11.0.106

	Ore Excavation (went from OreExcavation-1.4.129.jar to OreExcavation-1.4.133.jar):
		OreExcavation-1.4.133.jar:
			Fixed excavations on some modded tile entities resulting in crashes

			Note: Multi-block tile entities that previously crashed may not behave as expected when restored via UNDO. Recommended that these remain blacklisted from excavations.

	PlusTiC (went from [Archived file] to plustic-7.0.0.0.jar):

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.8.1-274.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.0-310.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.0-310.jar:
			New

			 * Major Minigun enhancements!
			 * Minigun now has a 4-slot inventory for ammo, saving valuable player inventory slots. The Minigun will only draw ammo from these slots.
			 * Sneak & Right-Click the Minigun to open the inventory and load ammo
			 * Ammo slots can be "locked" by middle-clicking a slot; when a slot is locked, the Minigun will only pull ammo from that slot. Useful when multiple ammo types are loaded.
			 * Added several new ammo types:
			 * Armor-Piercing: higher base damage, ignores armor, 250 shots per cartridge
			 * Incendiary: sets fire to targets, 500 shots per cartridge
			 * Freezing: slows targets, has chance to encase in damaging "ice", 500 shots per cartridge
			 * Weighted: very short range, high damage, 250 shots per cartridge
			 * Explosive: shots have chance to cause explosions (terrain damage off by default), 125 shots per cartridge
			 * Plain ammo remains as before, and is the only ammo type which can be potion-tipped
			 * Minigun can now take upgrades (use a Charging Station to install):
			 * Speed Upgrades: reduces spin-up time, chance to fire multiple rounds per shot, increased air usage
			 * Range Upgrades: increase range from 50 blocks to up to 80 blocks (5 blocks per upgrade), increased air usage
			 * Entity Tracker Upgrades: zooms in while firing
			 * Dispenser Upgrades: increase chance of all ammo types (including regular ammo with potions) proc'ing their effect, greatly increased air usage
			 * Item Life Upgrades: slowly replenish ammo when gun is in inventory for significant air usage
			 * Security Upgrade: prevent damage to pets and players
			 * Added Micromissiles: hand-held missile pods which can fire guided missiles with an explosive payload
			 * 100 missiles per pod (by default; configurable)
			 * Can configure missiles to balance between top speed, turn speed and damage
			 * Missiles will lock onto to nearest valid target; can filter targets with entity filters as used in other PneumaticCraft blocks & items
			 * Dumb-fire mode where missiles just fly in a straight line; slower but higher damage
			 * Missiles have a configurable launch cooldown (10 ticks by default)
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate now takes up to 4 Dispenser upgrades to enable an item launcher:
			 * Press & release the launch hotkey (default: Control + C) to charge the launcher and fire items/blocks
			 * Full charge takes 15 ticks
			 * Some items (arrows, eggs, TNT...) have special behaviour, similar to how a dispenser would operate
			 * Other items will be simply fired as item entities
			 * Other blocks will be fired as "tumbling block" entities, which try to reform as a block on contact with any other block. This allows torch launching functionality and other remote block placing, for example.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Programmer GUI improvements:
			 * Added a hi-res version of the GUI, used when the (scaled) resolution is 700x512 or higher. This hi-res GUI gives a much larger area for programming widgets.
			 * The GUI will now auto-recentre on the Start widget when a program is loaded from an item (drone, network storage) or from Pastebin, or if all widgets are off-screen when the GUI is re-opened.
			 * When the widget tray is open, middle-click can now also be used to open IGW docs for puzzle pieces (pressing 'I' still works, but the filter field has focus when the tray is open so the mouse is more convenient)
			 * Entity Filter strings can now be prefixed with a "!" to negate the check (e.g. "!zombie" means "anything except zombies")
			 * Entity Filter handling is now a bit more efficient in general (pre-parsing the filter string wherever possible, so less string processing)
			 * It is now possible to raise or lower the thermal resistance of blocks (e.g. magma, fire, etc) in config - see D:blockThermalResistanceMultiplier. Note that the thermal resistance of fluids is already configurable, via I:fluidThermalResistance.
			 * CraftTweaker: it is now possible to add Refinery recipes specifying a minimum temperature at which refining starts, with a new CT method "addRecipe(int minTemp, ILiquidStack input, ILiquidStack[] outputs)" . The existing addRecipe() method still works with a default minimum temp. of 373K.
			 * The Pneumatic Chestplate Magnet upgrade now also works on XP orbs.
			 * Camo Applicator now shows particle effects when applying/removing camo from a block.
			 * Recipes requiring vanilla chests now accepts any oredicted "chestWood" chests.
			Fixes

			 * Fixed Minigun Drone sync issue: minigun not orienting toward targets and not display bullet traces when firing
			 * Fixed bug where players sometimes take damage from jumping with Pneumatic Leggings + Range Upgrade (any fall damage from such a jump is supposed to be cancelled)
			 * Fixed bug where player targeting was off after being launched by an Item Cannon (most noticeable by fired arrows aiming much too low)
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Door dropping an item when breaking top half in creative mode
			 * Fixed messy block break particles when breaking a Pneumatic Door in survival mode
			 * Fixed crash when Pneumatic Door rotation is messed up (by other mods' rotation code)
			 * Fixed client crash when opening Refinery GUI while holding certain specific fluid containers.

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.8.4-303.jar:
			Updates

			 * The Kerosene Lamp can now hold 2000mB of fuel (up from 1000mb). This makes it practical to use fuel buckets to automatically fuel it (because the lamp reduces its lighting and fuel consumption when very low on fuel, it would previously run for ages on low lighting before exhausting its fuel supply and accepting a new bucket).
			 * Pneumatic Helmet Entity Tracker mob targeting warnings are now all handled server-side, reducing network traffic requirements and also resolving a client-side crash with certain modded entities (Ice & Fire Gorgons in particular, but potentially others).
			 * Restored some pre-0.8.0 functionality: the Aerial Interface once again allows access to the player's armor via the top face even when a Dispenser Upgrade is installed (but only when the top face is connected to armor). This was technically an unintended quirk, but some players were using it.
			 * Improved server-side performance of the Assembly Controller (smarter about discovering its machines), and made client-side GUI diagnostic messages more informative regarding duplicate and/or missing machines.
			 * Logistics Modules are now much cheaper to use in terms of air cost, especially for moving fluids:
			 * The air cost now increases linearly with distance instead of quadratically.
			 * The overall multiplier cost for items and fluids has also been halved.
			 * Example: moving 8000mB of fluid a distance of 20 blocks now costs 8000mL of air, instead of an impossible 320000mL.
			 * When there isn't enough air available in the tube to move the entire requested amount of items or fluid, the module will now move what it can instead of giving up and doing nothing. This makes Logistics Modules far more capable of moving resources over longer distances.
			 * Drone debug messages (accessed with Pneumatic Helmet + Entity Tracker & Dispenser Upgrades) now show elapsed time since last message of that type rather than the number of messages of that type, which wasn't too useful (and could also use a lot more memory than necessary in some situations).
			 * Drone Place Block program piece will now overwrite replaceable blocks such as tall grass & snow layers.
			 * Reduced Elevator sound volume depending on the number of individual elevators in a multiblock collection (each elevator plays the sound, so multiple elevators together can be quite loud).
			 * Drones can now pick up & drop Minecarts and Boats (including any passengers and/or contents) using Entity Import/Export programming pieces.
			 * In entity filters, "@boat" now matches boat entities.
			 * In entity filters, "@mob" now matches any hostile entity, including Slimes and Shulkers (which were previously not included).
			 * Added a new "Match by Block" checkbox to the Item Filter GUI in the Programmer, which is only used by the "Dig" programming piece. This allows Drones to match blocks which never drop an item, such as Abyssalcraft's Shoggoth Ooze. So you can get your Drones to clean up that nasty stuff now.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed a long-standing but rather subtle bug where Advanced Pressure Tubes only had 1000mL air volume following a world reload instead of the 4000mL they should have had. More details:
			 * Advanced Pressure Tubes are supposed to have a 4000mL volume, and they do when initially placed down. However due to a bug, upon reloading the world, their volume reverts to 1000mL (same as a basic Pressure Tube).
			 * This changes resolves that problem for new Advanced Pressure Tubes placed from now on.
			 * However, any pre-existing Advanced Pressure Tubes will need to be broken and replaced if you want to take advantage of their correct air volume.
			 * This isn't essential and you can replace tubes at your leisure. You will have improved air storage in your tube network once your tubes have re-pressurized.
			 * If you're using Logistics Modules, you will probably see the greatest benefit, since the newly fixed tubes are much more effective in moving items and fluids around due to their greater air storage.
			 * Fixed Vortex Cannon not always breaking plants/leaves/etc. even though the fired vortex appears to make contact.
			 * Fixed Vortex Cannon re-equip animation constantly being played if the held cannon is being charged from Pneumatic Chestplate or Aerial Interface.
			 * Fixed client crash when selecting area type in Area GPS Tool.
			 * Fixed client crash when selecting uninitialized GPS Tools in the GUI Inventory Search window.
			 * Fixed Elevators playing a spurious "elevator stop" sound to any players who log in nearby, even when the Elevator is idle.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.8.3-299.jar:
			Updates

			 * Elevator Base now accepts up to 4 Charging Upgrades. Each Charging Upgrade allows the elevator to reclaim some of the air spent to raise the elevator when the elevator descends again, up to a max of 60% of the air (15% per upgrade). This comes with the penalty of slower elevator descent (10% slower per upgrade).
			 * GUI side tabs now have a more visually appealing beveled border instead of a hard black border. If you prefer the old appearance, set the 'B:guiBevel' clientside option to false in pneumaticcraft.cfg.
			 * Aerial Interface has a new informational GUI side tab making it clear whether it's currently interfacing items or food/xp.
			 * Aerial Interface RF charging is now significantly more efficient on server CPU. Note however that it may take a couple of seconds to start charging items that have been newly added to your inventory, or have been moved in your inventory.
			 * Air Grate Module improvements:
			 * Now works on entity eye position, not feet position. If you can see it, it can see you...
			 * Range display box now accurately shows the range. It will appear for ~6 seconds when the module's range changes due to a pressure change.
			 * The Module now plays occasional air particles towards entities that it's affecting.
			 * Added config setting 'B:liquidHopperDispenser' to control whether the Liquid Hopper accepts a Dispenser Upgrade to pull or push fluids from/to the world. Default is true.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed client crash when opening Amadron GUI, introduced in 0.8.2.
			 * Fixed server crash in conjunction with Quark when a Drone breaks a tool/weapon (Quark auto item restock wasn't agreeing with the Drone's fakeplayer inventory).
			 * Fixed some text information being omitted from GUI Redstone side tabs.
			 * Fixed greater-than/less-than threshold not being toggleable in Pressure Gauge GUI (with Advanced PCB installed).
			 * Fixed problem with Aerial Interface sometimes showing the same XP fluid types more than once in the XP GUI side tab.
			 * Fixed visual artifacts when rendering Forge Energy bars in GUI's (Aerial Interface, Flux Compressor...)
			 * Fixed Omnidirectional Hopper failing to pull from some machines (noticed with Gregtech machines)
			 * Fixed player sometimes being left standing on top of an elevator frame and not being "collected" by a descending elevator platform.
			 * Fixed Pressure Chamber Interface allowing items to be piped in/out without checking that the corresponding door was fully open.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.8.2-288.jar:
			New

			 * Added a SCUBA Upgrade for the Pneumatic Helmet for underwater breathing and better underwater vision. It's an alternative to using the Aerial Interface, which still works; the Aerial Interface is more efficient in terms of air usage, but doesn't provide the clear vision (best option is of course to use both!)
			 * Added a Night Vision Upgrade for the Pneumatic Helmet. No prizes for guessing what that does.
			 * Added armor GUI controls for Pneumatic Leggings speed and jump upgrades, to allow the boost magnitude to be throttled back (0-100%). Useful if you want to e.g. reduce your jump height without needing to find a Charging Station to swap out upgrades from your armor.
			 * Electrostatic Compressor has been heavily reworked:
			 * No longer triggered by real lightning strikes. This was much too open to abuse via any other mod which can spawn a lightning entity (e.g. Psi)
			 * Instead, each compressor now has a chance to cause a fake lightning entity random with a 6-block circular radius of itself
			 * Iron bars grid are still important - the fake lightning bolt must strike a connected grid to be effective. Although the bars must be connected, they may be up to 5 blocks above or 5 blocks below the compressor.
			 * Strike chance is very low in clear weather, better in the rain, and much better in a thunderstorm
			 * Strike chance can be slightly improved by adding a lightning rod: a vertical column of iron bars up to 8 blocks directly above the compressor
			 * Multiple compressors can be connected to the same grid: generated pressure will be shared, as before.
			 * Chiseled Iron Bars are now also recognised as valid iron bars
			 * Added buttons to Air Cannon GUI allowing the force to be throttled between 0% and 100%. Allows finer control over the cannon's range than just adding Range Upgrades. The Air Cannon will now also aim lower if it can.
			 * New fancier particle effects for air rendering (air leaks, pressure chamber, jet boots...)
			 * Heat mechanics update: it is no longer possible to repeatedly break and replace a heat source block to stop it converting to stone/obsidian. That has always been considered an exploit. Using heat source blocks (lava/magma/pyrotheum...) is still a valid approach, but you will need to supply new materials to replaced the cooled ones.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Default thermal resistance for all fluids is now 500. Previously this only applied to flowing Lava and Water (all other fluids including static lava and water had a resistance of only 10). This means that Lava (and fluids such as Blazing Pyrotheum) is now a more effective heat source for blocks like the Refinery since they won't solidify almost immediately. This may not work for existing worlds; in this case, you can set D:fluidThermalResistance=500.0 in pneumaticcraft.cfg.
			 * The maximum number of Speed Upgrades in the Pneumatic Leggings has been raised from 3 to 4, for a 2x speed boost over default.
			 * Client-side rendering performance improvement when highlighting camouflageable blocks (while holding the Camouflage Applicator).
			 * To hover in-place with the Jet Boots, only 7 Jet Boots Upgrades are now required, instead of 10.
			 * Aerial Interface now uses much less air to keep a player's air topped up.
			 * Players will no longer take thorns damage when attacking (Elder) Guardians with the Minigun.
			 * Some more Pressure Chamber work:
			 * Client-side rendering (particles and items in chamber) is skipped if the chamber multiblock has no glass blocks.
			 * Particle rendering is skipped if the player is more than 16 blocks away from the chamber (specifically: the chamber's primary valve).
			 * A particle effect is played when the multiblock initially forms.
			 * Air particle density in the chamber now responds better to changes in chamber pressure (better syncing to clients).
			 * Pressure Chamber Interface door open/close sound is now a bit louder, but also no longer repeatedly plays over itself.
			 * Immersive Petroleum Gasoline is now accepted as a fuel in the liquid compressors by default; it's equivalent in quality to PneumaticCraft's Fuel.
			 * Sneak-wrenching a pneumatic machine now preserves any stored air in the dropped block (breaking the machine with a pick still loses stored air).
			 * Air leak sound pitch is now somewhat dependent on the pressure of the leak (higher pressure = higher-pitched leak sound)
			 * FoV change (zoom out) when Pneumatic Leggings speed boost is active has been removed. Added a clientside config setting D:leggingsFOVfactor if you prefer to keep the FoV adjustment (or would like a smaller adjustment) - 1.0 (default) for no adjustment, 0.0 for maximum adjustment.
			 * When Elevators are moving, Elevator Frames now "nudge" the player toward the centre of the block if they're hanging off by more than a little. Still possible to force-walk off the elevator platform if you're so inclined, though.
			 * Elevators now only "grab" entities within their frames if the entity is with 2.5 blocks vertically of the moving platform (previous behaviour was to grab regardless of height which can be a little... startling)
			 * Elevator Frames now only cancel fall damage if it's onto a moving elevator platform.
			 * Some IGW pages have had extra or clearer information added.
			 * Charging Module is lighter on server CPU now (CPU usage was quite heavy when charging a player's Pneumatic Armor via an Aerial Interface).
			 * Redid sound effect for Jet Boots a bit (lower-pitched, also modified to be lower & quieter when underwater)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed some configurable values (e.g. blocks per elevator base) not being adjustable from the default.
			 * Fixed a deadlock issue with the Omnidirectional Hopper. Under certain circumstances (all slots in the hopper partially full) it could fail to find suitable items in the input inventory.
			 * Fixed an item dupe in the Pressure Chamber under some fairly specific circumstances (related to performance improvements in 0.8.1).
			 * Fixed camouflageable blocks not being breakable with a pick (only a wrench) - related to camouflage updates in 0.8.1.
			 * Targeting Pressure Tube modules now works correctly for TOP & WAILA information display.
			 * Fixed some JEI Pressure Chamber recipes not showing the correct number of ingredients for some recipes (those items added by oredict key).
			 * Fixed an arithmetic rounding error causing Speed Upgrades to be less effective than they should have been in the Charging Station.
			 * Fixed problem with the Pneumatic Armor GUI causing a client crash when opened. I couldn't reproduce this myself, but I've had confirmation that my fix appears to have succeeded...
			 * Fixed cosmetic issue where Pneumatic Armor feature enable/disable message were shown even when the corresponding upgrade(s) weren't installed (the actual features were not enabled, though)
			 * Fixed a few cosmetic "Format Error" strings in GUI info tabs.
