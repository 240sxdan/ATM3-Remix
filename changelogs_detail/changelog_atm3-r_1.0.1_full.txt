	CraftTweaker (went from CraftTweaker2-1.12-4.1.11 to CraftTweaker2-1.12-4.1.9):
		CraftTweaker2-1.12-4.1.11:
			updated ZS head

			Some missing IIngredient#getInternal implementations

			recipes.replaceAllOccurences now supports an optional parameter that specifies recipes for which outputs shoudl be changed (uses IngredientAny in case no output was provided)

			Loaders now can be delayed/frozen until the mod that froze them calls the frozen alias. This should allow for mods to prevent a loader from being loaded to early by other mods. They now need to subscribe to the load_finished event, if they want to get the post-finished loader stage though.

			Added blockstate handling

			Fixed NBT matching (again!)

			Fixed recipe removal
		CraftTweaker2-1.12-4.1.10:
			Fixed JEI hide overriding item additions

			-People can use that logger, and packdevs can disable its outputs entirely.

			-that logger.

			Added INVALIDATED loader stage

			Added LoaderSkip info and AfterMerge info to default loader

			Refactored CrTLoadingStartedEvent's signature

			Made the block harvest event use weighted stacks

			made tooltips hardcoded to either shift key

			Changed how RemoveRecipeShaped works

			Add getRayTrace to IEntity

			Added onPlayerInteractBlock to IEventManager

			- Callthrough to onPlayerRightClickBlock due to naming inconsistense
			- See #595 for info

			Fixed NPE in SlotRecipe

			Make sure ActionRemoveRecipesNoIngredients runs before the other recipe removals

			CTGUI: Inputs now also use withTag to make the items look better in JEI

			performance improvements when looping over items (need to be implemented by the mod author, if you're a crt addon dev, look here: [https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/pull/600](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/pull/600))

			Fix NPE for getSubItems when no creativeTab was found.

			fix creative tab searching
