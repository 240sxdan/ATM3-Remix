	Just Enough Dimensions (went from justenoughdimensions-1.12.2-1.6.0-dev.20180411.215951.jar to justenoughdimensions-1.12.2-1.6.0-dev.20180502.030835.jar):
		justenoughdimensions-1.12.2-1.6.0-dev.20180502.030835.jar:
			 * Fix not changing to spectator if dying in hardcore and other related fixes
			 * When a player dies in a hardcore mode dimension, they are now switched to spectator mode properly (in vanilla the hardcore mode status of the server was what caused this to happen, JED now checks/does it per-dimension)
			 * The hardcore status of a dimension is now synced to the client (so that you can see the hardcore mode hearts for example)
			 * The DataTracker won't do the automatic gamemode switches with ForceGameMode dimensions anymore when changing dimensions, if the player died in a hardcore mode dimension and was thus changed to spectator mode
		justenoughdimensions-1.12.2-1.6.0-dev.20180430.171151.jar:
			 * Added a dummy '/jed broadcast <type>' command that can be used by other mods to detect certain events
			 * Currently it's only executed after a '/jed delete-dimension' command and is used by World Primer to reset the dimension load count of that dimension
		justenoughdimensions-1.12.2-1.6.0-dev.20180428.203700.jar:
			 * Added an option to customize the spawn point search type and y range
			 * This makes it possible to have JED find a proper spawn point for example in the Erebus dimension
			 * Example usage: [https://pastebin.com/MW16pnVn](https://pastebin.com/MW16pnVn)
			 * Valid types are 'overworld' and 'cavern', where 'cavern' is the same search algorithm already used for the Nether in JED
			 * Added a new command '/jed delete-dimension' to delete/reset dimensions, by deleting their data directory. It does not unregister the dimension.
			 * The usage is '/jed delete-dimension 123' followed by '/jed delete-dimension 123 confirm', where 123 is the dimension ID
