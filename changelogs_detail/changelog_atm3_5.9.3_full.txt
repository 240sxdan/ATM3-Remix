		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.6.jar:
			 * Shadow mobs are now immune to fire, and capable of swimming
			 * Changed the texture for Liquid Antimatter (darker spots within the liquid, making it a bit less milk-like)

			 * Dread-plagued mobs now automatically leave a lingering cloud of Dread Plague on death
			 * Added a new config category for misc out of place settings
			 * The amount of animals a Lesser Shoggoth has to eat in order to multiply/grow up now depends on the size of the animals it eats (1 adult cow = 3 adult chickens)
			 * The advancement trigger for summoning entities now fires for nearby players when completing a Summoning Ritual
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.5.jar:
			 * Applying a redstone signal to an Energy Relay pauses it
			 * The Overworld biomes are always registered now, just not added to the list of biomes to generate if set not to
			 * Statues can now transfer PE to dropped items (provided they can accept PE)
			 * Redrafted a bunch of text inside the Necronomicon (removing redundant/incorrect information and adding new information)
			 * Replaced all mob pictures in the Necronomicon with ones that look more like something drawn in the book
			 * Fixed an infinite loop in the mining spell when mining upwards
			 * Added a small section that explains how to obtain knowledge, unlocking information in the Necronomicon and unmasks Items and Blocks
			 * Reduced the duration of fire applied to attackers when attacking someone wearing Dreaded Abyssalnite gear
			 * The Coralium Plague and Dread Plague now act more like actual plagues (they spread a lot easier, can't be cured with milk)
			 * Abyssalnite Golems now turn into Dreaded Abyssalnite Golems if killed by the Dread Plague
			 * Portals now have a small chance of spawning a mob from their dimension
			 * Shadow mobs now change their transparency based on light level (bright = visible, dark = not so visible)
			 * The Dreadlands can leak out of it's portals, so keep a lookout in case too much gets out
			 * Added Antidotes for the Coralium and Dread Plague (used to cure them instead of milk, which no longer cures them)
			 * Increased the amount of Coralium Ore that generates in the Overworld (also made it configurable)
			 * Knowledge unlock syncing is now done on a per unlock basis, rather than when opening the Necronomicon or changing dimensions
			 * Asorah and Spectral Dragons now have the undead creature attribute

			 > Place a piece of cobblestone and iron ingot in the array. The array deals damage to any living entity that enters
